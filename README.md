# 🧱 Bricks: The Foundation

> **"Do you wish to rise? Begin by descending. You plan a tower that will pierce the clouds? Lay first the foundation of humility." - Saint Augustine **

Welcome to the **Bricks** repository.

## 📖 About The Collection

This repository contains the "Bricks" — a series of 100 focused, isolated applications built to master specific concepts of Full Stack Software Engineering.

Unlike my **Showcase Projects** (which are complex, production-ready SaaS applications found in "The Showcase"), these Bricks are designed for:
1.  **Specific Skill Acquisition** (e.g., mastering `useEffect`, API integration, or 3D rendering).
2.  **Rapid Prototyping** (Moving from idea to code in < 4 hours).
3.  **Content Creation** (Documenting the journey on YouTube).

**Goal:** Build 100 Bricks to bridge the gap between "Tutorial Hole" and "Software Engineer."

## 🚀 How to Run a Brick

Since this is a monorepo approach for learning, navigate to the specific brick folder:

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IsaiahDoesDev/Bricks.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the brick:**
    ```bash
    cd 01-neon-light
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
